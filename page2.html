        <br>
        Once upon a time, in a peaceful village, lived a little girl named Amina.<br>
         Every evening, she would sit on the bright woven carpet in her home, waiting for her motherâ€™s special dish.
         <br> She loved the warmth of the spices, the colors of the vegetables, and most of all, the love her mother put into the food.
         <br> Amina believed that each bite carried a blessing, filling her with joy and strength. 
         <br>As she ate with a smile, she whispered a little prayer of gratitude, knowing that happiness was not in riches, but in the simple blessings of family, food, and faith.
