The Rabbit and the Bluebird 
</i>
</h1> 
<br>

In a quiet forest, beside a sparkling stream, lived a gentle rabbit named Luma.
<br>
One morning, while playing near the ferns, Luma found a tiny bluebird trembling with fear.
<br>


The little bird had fallen from its nest and didn’t know how to fly 

Luma gently picked up the bird and whispered, “Don’t be afraid, I will help you.”
<br>
He comforted the bird with his warm paws as sunlight softly filtered through the trees.

The flowers swayed gently, as if cheering for their new friendship.
<br>
Together, Luma and the bluebird searched for the nest high up in a tree.
<br>
At last, with a joyful hop and a little flutter, the bird was safely back home.
<br>
The bluebird chirped sweetly, thanking Luma for his kindness.
<br>
From that day on, the rabbit and the bluebird became the best of friends, always meeting by the sparkling stream.
